# Jellypane

A feature-rich glassmorphism theme for Jellyfin 10.9.X with scroll-snap glass panels; go from a minimalist experience to full details with one increment of the mousewheel, accessible & sleek fonts, spoiler-free episode selection, responsive design and also an easy-to-setup [Featured Content bar](https://github.com/tedhinklater/finality?tab=readme-ov-file#featured-content-bar-by-bobhasnosoul-and-sethbacon) as a finishing touch.

Paste this line into your Custom CSS box

```css

@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/Jellypane@main/Jellypane.css");

```

Or use this version if you don't want the scroll-snap feature (Firefox is great but Jellyfin Media Player really does not like it, for example)

```css

@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/Jellypane@main/Jellypane(NoSnap).css");

```

Important: Click your User icon in Jellyfin, go to Display, scroll down and make sure the Theme is "Dark" and Backdrops are enabled.
