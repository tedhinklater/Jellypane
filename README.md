Paste this line into your Custom CSS box

```css

@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/Jellypane@main/Jellypane.css");

```

Or use the version below if you don't want the scroll-snap feature (browsers are great but JMP really does not like it, for example)

```css

@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/Jellypane@main/Jellypane(NoSnap).css");

```

Important: Click your User icon in Jellyfin, go to Display, scroll down and make sure the Theme is "Dark" and Backdrops are enabled.
